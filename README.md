# Rooker üê¶‚Äç‚¨õ

I like the game of Rook. There are other apps that keep track of your score, but they are not free. This project uses modern iOS frameworks to deliver a simple, fast, and native app to keep your score. I hope to make it fun and interactive with time. I like crazy things like skeuomorphism and neumorphism. I would enjoy making this app different. 

## Contributing

Currently I am the only developer. Since I just started this project with the base Xcode template, I probably won't accept contributions until the project is more stable. After that, I would be thrilled for the community to help make this app wonderful. 

## To-do

The MVP (minimal viable product) for this project is simple: allow the user to create players, teams, and games. You will enter the bid for each round and the score for each team at the end of the round. Cool features might come later (like stats on each person's bidding history, rounds won, etc).

- [ ] build out model for data structure
- [ ] view to create games
      The user can choose from existing players or create new ones at this step.
- [ ] view to create players
- [ ] view to create teams (maybe not necessary...I don't want it to be a hassle)
- [ ] game view
- [ ] history view
- [ ] stats view (with filters for teams, players)
